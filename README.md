# NBA-Latent-Variable-Modeling
Predicting NBA game outcomes is a complex problem that benefits from probabilistic reasoning and latent variable modeling. In this repo, we propose using a Bayesian Network with latent team strength variables to model the probability of a home team victory, conditioned on home/away context and game-level features.
